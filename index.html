  <h2> WEB</h2>

  <p>Web standards are the formal, non-proprietary standards and other technical specifications that define and describe aspects of the World Wide Web.
     In recent years, the term has been more frequently associated with the trend of endorsing a set of standardized best practices for building web sites,
     and a philosophy of web design and development that includes those methods.</p>

  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
